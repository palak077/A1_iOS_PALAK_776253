Create an iOS application that will do the following:
1. Display the location of the user on the map with a proper zooming.
2. Display markers on a map for three different cities in the province of Ontario. The input for the cities should be provided by the user by a long press gesture on the map. After the third marker, connect each point on the map with a straight line of green colour and fill the area created by the triangle with red colour (50% transparency).
3. The titles of the markers should be ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’.
4. If the user taps on the same location as one of the markers (or close by) the application should remove the marker from the map.
5. For the fourth tap and when the tap is not close by any other markers, you should remove every marker and overlays from the map and display again your first marker (title ‘A’).
6. Display the distance between each marker and your location in the detail callout accessory view of each marker.
7. Implement a button so that the application should provide route guidance from point A to point B to point C and back to point A. when you press the button, you should remove every overlay from the map and just display the route guidance between the markers.# A1_iOS_PALAK_776253
